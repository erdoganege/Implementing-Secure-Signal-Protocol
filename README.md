# Implementing-Signal-Protocol
Sabanci University CS411 - Cryptography Course Project <br/>
**Implementation** of the **Signal Protocol** as a demonstration of **secure** end-to-end encryption.

* **Phase 1:** Developed software for the Public Key Registration
* **Phase 2:** Developed software for receiving messages from other clients
* **Phase 3:** Developed software to communicate with other clients

## Used Technologies/Algorithms:<br/>
* **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for **key exchange protocol and digital signature** algorithm with NIST-256 curve
* **Hash based MAC (HMAC - SHA256)** function is used for **authentication**
* **AES128-CTR** is used for message encryption

## For detailed explaination of each phases check the [project assignment](https://github.com/erdoganege/Implementing-Signal-Protocol/blob/main/TERM%20PROJECT.pdf)
